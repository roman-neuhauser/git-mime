  `NAME`
       `git-mime` â€” Prepare patches for email submission


  `SYNOPSIS`
       `git-mime` [options] [--] <REV>

  `DESCRIPTION`
       `git-mime` formats a commit identified by `REV` as a MIME message.

    Options
       `--output=FILE`
          Place the output in *FILE* instead of default *stdout*.

       `--dirstat`, `--numstat`, `--shortstat`, `--stat`, `--no-stat`
          See *git-show(1)*, with the caveat that these options are mutually
          exclusive in `git-mime` (at most one kind of diffstat is output),
          and `--no-stat` disables all kinds of diffstat.
          Last option specified wins.

       `--summary`, `--no-summary`
          Output a summary of filemode changes such as creations, deletions,
          renames and mode changes.  Last option specified wins.

  `ENVIRONMENT`
       `git-mime` itself does not use any environment variables.
       It is, however, implemented in terms of third-party commands
       which do use them.  This means `git-mime` may be influenced by
       environment variables used by *git(1)*, *zsh(1)*, possibly others.

  `DIAGNOSTICS`
       The `git-mime` utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

  `SEE ALSO`
       *git-format-patch(1)*, *hg(1)*, *mime-construct(1)*.
